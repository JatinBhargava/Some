Database Migration:
Definition:
Database migration is the process of making structured changes to a database schema to adapt it to new requirements, improvements, or fixes. These changes can include modifying tables, adding or removing columns, updating data, and other adjustments needed to keep the database schema in sync with the evolving needs of an application.

Challenges in Database Migration:
Data Integrity:
Ensuring that data remains accurate and consistent during the migration process is a critical challenge.
Downtime Minimization:
Minimizing downtime during migrations is essential, especially in production environments where interruptions can impact users.
Version Control:
Tracking and managing changes to the database schema over time is crucial for collaboration and maintaining a reliable history of modifications.
Dependency Management:
Handling dependencies between migrations, where changes in one migration may rely on the completion of another, adds complexity.
Rollback Strategies:
Having effective rollback strategies in case of issues during the migration process is necessary to revert changes and maintain system stability.
How Flyway Helps:
1. Version Control:

Flyway provides a structured way to version control database changes using SQL scripts. Each script is associated with a version number, making it easy to track and manage changes.
2. Simple Configuration:

Flyway is easy to set up and configure, allowing developers to integrate it into their projects with minimal effort.
3. Migration Scripts:

Flyway uses plain SQL migration scripts, making it accessible and allowing developers to use familiar SQL syntax.
4. Schema Evolution:

Flyway supports the evolution of database schemas over time. It can automatically apply new migrations when the application starts, ensuring that the database schema stays up-to-date.
5. Consistency Across Environments:

Flyway helps maintain consistency across development, testing, and production environments by allowing developers to apply the same set of migrations.
6. Dependency Management:

Flyway understands and manages dependencies between migrations, ensuring that changes are applied in the correct order.
7. Rollback Support:

Flyway provides support for rolling back migrations, allowing you to revert changes in case of errors or issues.
8. Command-Line Interface (CLI):

Flyway's CLI enables interactive migration and provides commands for migrating, validating, and undoing changes.
9. Database Support:

Flyway supports a wide range of databases, making it versatile for projects that use different database systems.
