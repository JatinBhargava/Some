Hi Chaitanya,

I made the change for 'phaci delete' a few days ago. The update was necessary because I modified a part of the code where keeping the previous column name would have caused failures. To ensure consistency across all scripts and data, I had to rename the column.

Once the latest code is deployed in CDP ST, I will update the column name to its corrected version. Please let me know when the deployment is completed.

PS: I will inform Inftent in advance if I need to make such changes in the future.

Best,
