1. What is Flyway?
Flyway is an open-source database migration tool that simplifies the process of evolving your database schema over time. It enables you to manage changes to your database in a structured and versioned way, making it easy to collaborate with a team and deploy changes across different environments.

2. Why Use Flyway?

Version Control for Databases: Just like you version control your code using tools like Git, Flyway helps you version control your database schema changes. Each change is represented by a migration script, which is a plain SQL file.
Automated Migrations: Flyway automates the process of applying database migrations. It tracks the current version of your database and applies the necessary migrations to bring it up to date.
Consistency Across Environments: With Flyway, you can ensure that your database schema is consistent across development, testing, and production environments. This reduces the chances of deployment errors due to schema inconsistencies.
3. How Does Flyway Work?

Migration Scripts: Changes to the database are represented as migration scripts. These scripts are written in SQL and are organized in a versioned and structured manner.
Version Control: Each migration script has a version number, and Flyway keeps track of the current version of the database. When you run Flyway, it automatically applies the pending migrations to update the database schema.
Easy Integration: Flyway can be easily integrated into your development workflow, build tools (like Maven or Gradle), and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
4. Basic Steps to Use Flyway:

Install Flyway: Download and install Flyway on your machine or include it in your project's dependencies.
Configure Database Connection: Specify the database connection details in the Flyway configuration.
Create Migration Scripts: Write SQL scripts to represent the changes you want to make to the database schema.
Run Flyway: Execute Flyway to apply the migrations and update the database schema.
5. Additional Features:

Rollbacks: Flyway supports rollbacks, allowing you to revert to a previous version of the database schema if needed.
Callbacks and Hooks: You can define callbacks or hooks to execute custom logic before or after each migration.
Placeholders: Flyway supports placeholders, allowing you to parameterize your SQL scripts.
In summary, Flyway simplifies and automates the process of managing database schema changes, providing version control and consistency across different environments. It's a valuable tool for developers and teams working on projects that involve frequent database schema updates.
