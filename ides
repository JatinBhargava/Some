ndividuals and businesses struggle with inefficient tax planning, inaccurate expense tracking, and missed tax-saving opportunities. Traditional tax filing and expense management solutions lack real-time insights, fail to provide personalized tax-saving strategies, and do not seamlessly integrate with multi-currency, multi-jurisdictional tax compliance requirements.

The system categorizes users into age brackets and provides customized tax-saving strategies and financial insights.
